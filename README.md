# Toxic-Comment-Classification

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to classify toxic comments. Itâ€™s built to help detect and filter harmful language in user-generated content, making it a valuable tool for applications in social media moderation, community management, and user-generated content platforms.

## Features

- **Multi-Label Classification**: Identifies multiple types of toxicity (e.g., insult, threat, hate speech) within comments.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained with logistic regression and Naive Bayes classifiers to ensure high accuracy and generalization.
- **Text Processing**: Implements extensive preprocessing steps, including stopword removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Model Performance**: Explore advanced models, such as transformers or deep learning, to improve classification accuracy.
- **Extended API Integration**: Deploy the model as a web service for real-time moderation.
- **Support for Additional Languages**: Expand preprocessing to support multilingual toxic comment detection.
